dvbtscut
========

A simple utility for extracting part of a DVB transport stream based
on timestamps.

USAGE

dvbtscut reads from stdin and writes to stdout. Options are:

-s hh:mm:ss.sss  Start point (optional - defaults to start of stream)
-e hh:mm:ss.sss  End point (optional - defaults to end of stream)
-t               Test mode - do not write any output


The timestamps are the PTS values stored in the video/audio streams -
dvbtscut looks at all streams and will cut based on the first stream
which meets the start/end point criteria.

These timestamps do not start at zero at the start of the file, they
are whatever was sent in the DVB stream.

To find the first timestamp in the stream, do:

dvbtscut -t < file.ts

The first PTS will then be displayed as dvbtscut continues to scan
through the whole file.

To identify other cut points, you can use mplayer to play the stream.
Pressing the "o" button will cause mplayer to display the timestamps
via its OSD.


NOTES

dvbdemux currently supports the following types of streams:

MPEG video streams (stream_id 0xe0-0xef)
MPEG audio streams (stream_id 0xc0-0xcf)
Private Data 1 streams (stream_id 0xbd)

Private Data 1 streams in the context of DVB broadcasting normally
contain subtitles or AC3 audio.
