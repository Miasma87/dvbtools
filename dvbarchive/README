dvbarchive
----------

dvbarchive is designed to run 24/7 and will continuously archive a
single DVB multiplex.

Using command-line options, you specify the tuning parameters, the
list of channels (identified by their "service id") and the base
directory for the recordings to be written to.

dvbarchive will create one directory for each service, prefixing the
service name with the LCN (logical channel number) if available.
